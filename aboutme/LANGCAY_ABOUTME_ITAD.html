    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born on th 20th of April 2001 in Mary Chiles Hospital in Sampaloc, Manila.<sup>1</sup> 
		I'm an only child, I should have 3 siblings by now but they were all miscarried.<sup>2</sup> My first sibling was miscarried when I was still in the 3rd 
		grade.<sup>3</sup> during that time I was happy because I can get to play with my sibling but after knowing that my sibling wasn't able to be fully 
		developed. <sup>4</sup> I felt sad and went home crying without my parents knowing, the same thing happened to my other 2 siblings. <sup>5</sup> But despite 
		that, I'm still happy because I have my cousins and friends who I see as my brothers and sisters whenever I feel lonely.<sup>6</sup> Enough about my sad 
		childhood, let's start with me elementary years! <sup>7</sup> I started school when I was 6 years old, pretty early for some but my Mom wanted me to go to 
		school at that early without knowing why until now.<sup>8</sup> I was doing well in my early years until I met basketball and technology. <sup>9</sup> I 
		had my first computer when I was in 4th grade, and after that, I was slowly flunking my grades in school because I got so addicted to computer games. 
		<sup>10</sup> Basketball on the other hand was my priority that time because I dreamed to be in the NBA that time. <sup>11</sup>My favorite player that time
		was Kobe Bryant, I loved the way he shoots the ball and how he puts in his heart every game.<sup>12</sup>Kobe was the main reason why I fell inlove to the 
		game, he taught me to treat every game as your last game of your life, and mind this that it was not even an official game. <sup>13</sup> I was only playing 
		pickup games with my friends and I was being so competitive.<sup>14</sup>I was focusing too much on computer and basketball that I almost failed some of my 
		subjects in elementary school. <sup>15</sup> Even though my grades were falling, that didn't stop me from graduating elementary school, I still manage to 
		get good grades and graduated elementary school. <sub>16</sub> Elementary school was not my best years to enjoy my childhood life, but it surely taught me 
		many lessons that I can carry until I grow old. <sup>17</sup> Some of the lessons I learned was from my friends who are also the same age as mine. 
		<sup>18</sup> It's hard to leave my childhood because it was one of the reasons I am today.<sup>19</sup> My childhood shaped me to Jeremy I am today, and I 
		will never forget that. <sup>20</sup> </blockquote></p>

    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage life started when I graduated elementary school. <sup>1</sup> Of course, new school, new 
		me.<sup>2</sup> Despite my grades being not that high, I still manage to get into one of my favorite schools which is Stella Maris College. <sup>3</sup> The
		school used to be an all girls institution but years passed, they finnally decided to add boys in their school. <sup>4</sup> I remember how hard it is for 
		me to adjust to a new environment, in my old school we were only 17 students, we have no sections or anything, just 1 class per grade. <sup>5</sup> In Stella,
		we were 41 in each classroom and we had 5 sections. <sup>6</sup> In my childhood years, I was dreaming of becoming a professional basketball player. 
		<sup>7</sup> After my entrance examination in my Junior High school which was Stella Maris, I immediately went to the gym and asked the coach if they are 
		recruiting rookies. <sup>8</sup> The coach said "show me what you got kid, bring your things tomorrow." <sup>9</sup> It was my first tryout in my life and 
		I felt very pressure because if ever I got in the team, I get to represent my school! <sup>10</sup> The coach was satisfied with the performance I showed at 
		tryouts and I manage to secure a spot on the team. <sup>11</sup> After I got a spot on the team something bad happened, I dislocated my left index finger 
		and had to be removed from the team and needed to be replaced as soon as possible. <sup>12</sup> After that, I went home and cried to my mom. <sup>13</sup> 
		After my recovery from my injury I went and practice with the team again, I got in the team again. <sup>14</sup> This was at my 9th grade, I got injured 
		again but this time my right ankle. <sup>15</sup> I get injured so many times but that didn't stop me from my dream of becoming a professional basketball 
		player. <sup>16</sup> I focused on my school since I can't play basketball because of my injuries, despite my effort from 9th grade I still wasnt able to 
		get an award because of my tardiness in school. <sup>17</sup> That time I live in Marikina City which is a 15-30 min commute ride away from my school, so 
		I need to get up early to get there on time.<sup>18</sup> If I hadn't been late for almost every of my class, I could've gotten an award and made my parents 
		happy. <sup>19</sup> I graduated my Junior Highschool not so happy, because I was always thinking about the team, why did I have to suffer under my injuries, 
		that time it made me a lot stronger to work harder on my next school and make it to collegiate league. <sup>20</sup> </blockquote></p>

    	<blockquote><p> Highschool life was my best and worst memories of my life. <sup>1</sup> I had so many ups and downs, heartaches and heartbreaks, but despite 
		all my salty memories, HS life was filled with memories with my friends. <sup>2</sup> Getting a school in college was very tough for me, first I don't know 
		what to take even though we had NCAE(National Career Assessment Examination). <sup>3</sup> At picking my school, I carefully researched on what Universities 
		offer fun extra curricular activities, such as intramurals, concerts, seminars and etc. <sup>4</sup> There are 3 schools that has best extra curricular 
		activities they are Far Eastern University, University of Santo Tomas, and University of the East. <sup>5</sup> I ended up picking UE because one, tuition's 
		is affordable, and it has CHED's center of excellence in Information Technology.<sup>6</sup> After I finished my entrance examination, I went back home and 
		called the nnumber of the coach via telephone and asked him what should I do and bring for the tryouts. <sup>7</sup> When I arrived at the gym I got 
		intimidated by the height and skill of the other players, some of them were spot on three point line and some of them even do monstrous dunks. <sup>8</sup> 
		I asked myself "do I really need to be here?", that's the time I decided to go back home and didn't pursue to practice with the team because I might not be 
		able to make it to the lineup. <sup>9</sup> I just focused on school more and wait another opportunity to come to represent UE, its my long time dream as a 
		student to represent the school from something like a tournament or any other activities. <sup>10</sup> But I just can't leave basketball like that, I need 
		to somehow try it, who knows I might make it to the team. <sup>11</sup> After that moment I went and played pickup games with my friends from our court near 
		our house. <sup>12</sup> After we played something bad happen, I dislocated my left knee.<sup>13</sup> I was rushed in to the hospital in pain because my 
		knee was really hurtinng so bad. <sup>14</sup> We got to the hospital and the doctor said to try and pull my knee to its original position then take a MRI 
		to see if we need to repair something around your knee. <sup>15</sup> To cut the long story short, I ended up getting an operation, the doctor said that it 
		might happen again if I didn't get any operation. <sup>16</sup> After that, I told to myself that basketball isn't for me, I got injured for 4 times, maybe 
		that's just destiny telling me to stop playing and focus on something else. <sup>17</sup> I focused more on school other than anything else, but when the 
		pandemic came, there's a new computer game that really hooked me in. <sup>18</sup> Since it's online class, I might as well do this after my classes and see 
		if I can do something with it. <sup>19</sup> Guess what, the organization that I'm with is making a Valorant team to represent the school for an interschool 
		tournament! <sup>20</sup> After that news, I immediately grind my way to become a better player, so now, I dont focus on playing basketball anymore, my main 
		focus is to get better at this game and get good grades at the same time so that I can represent my school and make them proud! <sup>21</sup> Instead of 
		dreaming to become a basketball player, now I dream to be an Esports player! <sup>22</sup></blockquote></p>
